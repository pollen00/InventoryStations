Inventory Crafting Stations allows you to use crafting stations that are in your inventory, piggy bank, safe, forge, void bank, or an open chest without placing them down.

Also Includes ~
 ~ Liquid support (just use a bucket).
 ~ Magic Storage integration, stations in your inventory will function within the crafting block.
 ~ Magic Storage biome emulation support (Snow Biome Emulator and Biome Globe).
 ~ Config options to disable any of the inventory checks.
 Note: Liquid does not work in Magic Storage due to a bug I am too lazy to find a workaround to, may be fixed after the next Magic Storage update.

This is the alpha branch (obviously) so make sure to report bugs if you experience any.
